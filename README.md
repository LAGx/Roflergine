Hi, there!

This project was created as a field of experimental and learning, how the game engine works.
If you want to create some realization of Game Engine System and implement it`s on practice
you can join us! We glad to see any newcomers.

Any feature should be designed on the wiki. This feature will be developed on a separate branch.
And then, after code review will merge to master.

P.S. I didn`t set up processes properly yet. It is in progress to find out what process will be best.
